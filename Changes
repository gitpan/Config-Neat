Revision history for Config-Neat

1.1     26 Oct 2014

        - Fixed and simplified parsing for repeating nodes

        - More parsing tests; use subtests for better structuring

1.0     25 Oct 2014

        - Added the support for 'LIST' schema type
          to always cast single or multiple entries with the
          same name to an array (list) of nested items

        - Replace File::Slurp with File::Slurp::Tiny
          (as per https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=95680)

        - is_any_hash, is_any_array convenience functions
          in Config::Neat::Util

0.9     11 May 2014

        - Implemented proper cascaded inheritance

0.8     10 May 2014

        - Fix inheriting the same local paths from different files
          (save the file name as a part of the cache item key)

0.7     11 April 2014

        - Automatically convert merged node to an IxHash
          if necessary

        - Allow casting any hash to an array

        - Support rendering default hash values

        - Do not count the key length for the hash keys
          that don't have values

0.6     12 March 2014

        - Add the minimal version requirement for Test::More (0.94)

        - Must clone node before putting it into the cache;
          added test for multiple node reuse

0.5     04 March 2014

        - Report a proper error when trying to render objects
          of unsupported types

        - Tests no longer have any hardcoded paths in the
          reference data

0.4     02 March 2014

        - A more correct schema-based automatic casting
          from HASH to ARRAY (+ additional test)

        - Add File::Slurp to the list of build prerequisites

0.3     28 February 2014

        - By default, hashes are now merged (no need to set '+'
          prefix for the merged key); arrays, on the contrary,
          are replaced by default, so '+' is needed to merge
          their values

        - When merging nodes, the original order of the keys
          is preserved

        - Support for hashes with mixed explicitly set and
          automatically generated indexed keys; hashes
          with sequential numbering can be cast to ARRAY
          automatically using Config::Neat::Schema

        * Initial CPAN release *

0.2     23 February 2014

        - Support multiple key declarations at the same level
          (these will be converted to an array).

        - Support installation via Module::Build

...
